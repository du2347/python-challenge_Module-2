This file also contains: 
Financial analysis text with a concluding statement that answers the aforementioned objectives. 
The CSV file (budget_data.csv.xls) that has PyBank data for reference.

## PyRamen - Data Analysis 
### Objective: Analyzing product performance per-product analysis for a fictional company by manipulating data through Python.
It should be noted this financial script and analysis is slightly different from PyBank and has more objectives, such as data manipulation. 

The purpose of using Python in this context is to provide a more innovative, effective, and efficient solution to formulate conclusions on a corporation's performance per-product basis and identify which products should be eliminated or modified. 

Using Python codes and a well-defined financial script such as the one in this file allows an enterprise to automate its calculations to ensure it can adapt and grow with evolving business needs. 

The PyRamen file contains: 
A detailed Python script and code. 
Financial analysis text with a concluding statement that answers the aforementioned objectives. The CSV files menu_data.csv and sales_data.csv that have PyRamen data for reference.
